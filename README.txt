UNIT TESTS:
    To run all unit tests, cd into pengumon directory and use the following command:

    pytest 

    This will automatically discover and run all test files (test_*.py) inside the pengumon/ directory. 
    All tests use pytest and are designed to be self-contained and reproducible.

    If you only want to run tests for a specific module, (for example, enemyAI) run:

    pytest test_enemyAI.py
